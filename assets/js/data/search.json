Computers have become more powerful over the time due to the relenless march of the Moores’s Law (or observation) but we are reaching the end of silicon based chips due to physicall limitation of our current technology to cram more transistors in a die as close as physically possible. If we are to move forward, we need to invent new technologies to go beyond the current limits. May be we need other forms of fundamental compute engine using light perhaps (Photonic comupters) or may be Quantum computers?Still we can achieve more with current (transistor based) computers especially with the help of AI. In fact AI is going to give us better tools to invent future technologies: it will help us advance in material science and nano technology which will inturn enable us to get to Photonic and Quantum computers faster.There are still some basic issue we need to deal with before we can move forward, especially with Human interfaces to these vastly capable machines. If we still rely on current (text or speach based) interfaces, we will not be able to use the complete potential of these next generation computers. Humans need to step up to meet the needs of Machines as we become the bottleneck.I think we need to think and speak at the speed of light literally if we need to make any progress…… to be updated…" }, { "title": "Jobs to be done (by Humans)", "url": "/posts/jobs-to-be-done/", "categories": "Tech, future-talk, AGI", "tags": "ML, AI, LLM, GPT, tech, future-talk, autonnomy, agents, agi", "date": "2023-11-04 22:30:00 +0530", "snippet": "Future Talk #3 - There will always be “Jobs to be done” by HumansIn this Post, I will be talking about the future of Human laborThere have been many speculations on a Post AGI world, especially aro...", "content": "Future Talk #3 - There will always be “Jobs to be done” by HumansIn this Post, I will be talking about the future of Human laborThere have been many speculations on a Post AGI world, especially around human labor. What will be the “Jobs to be done” by humans when we have AGI. There are talks about having a Universal Basic Income (UBI) for all humans as we disengage from Active Labor, where all the mundane jobs are taken over by Agents, Bots which will be guided by one or more AGIs. When we get there, how will human life be transformed? what will we do to keep ourselves sane? These are the hard questions to answer.It is not IF but When and How.The path to Post labor era has already begun with GPT4 and Microsoft Co-Pilot. MS will push hard to “Innovate” and transform the workplace - Make current office work more productive. This is similar to what we saw when Graphical computing was introduced, which allowed an order of mangniture change in what people can do with computers. Many predicted the colapse of workforce marketplace as they thought that computers will take our the jobs of mechanics and manufacurers. They did, but we entered into a new era - the information era. Similar transformation is due to the workforce. It is time to transform from Information Era to the Knowledge Era, where human labor is not the driver of value creation. Humans will be contributing to the knowledge base and help AGIs create new values through exponential advancements in science and technology.Here are some of the outcomes of this transformation: The elimination of disease (be in infectious or inherited). The elimiation of poverty and human suffering. Advancement in enery production, storage and consumption. The attainment of the age of abundance (Infinite Resources, Infinite possibilities).Apart from the above, we will also see indirect outcomes such as: Lifespan extensions. People could literally live forever, if they prefer.

When we extrapolate this trend we will end up with a swarm of automonous agents representing the whole of humanity and AI interacting in a virtal world, providing agency to both Human and Machine intelligence. It will be alien as well as familiar to us. Here is what I mean…I am a student, father, husband, employee, consumer and producer. I will be represented by these entities as intelligent agents to other intelligent agents, some representing other humans and some entirely AI. We will deligate our tasks to these agents and we will watch as they go about living our lives in this virtual world. We will watch them succeed and fail in some cases. We will be there to coach and train these agents to maximize our happiness and reduce suffering.

I think many forget that Gen AI is not a thing that happened suddenly but was in the making since the age of the transformers(Published in 2017 as part of the research paper - Attention is All You Need by Vaswani et al.). Google missed the boat on this and it is going to come back to haunt them while OpenAI and Microsoft reap the benefits of it. In any case, the biggest short term benefit of Gen AI is not in the technology it enables but empty sales pitch that many software companies use to promise extra ordinary claims and sell vapourware with little or no regard to the data that these LLMs used to train on and the lack of attributions those companies are giving to the real humans who created those data.I don’t even like the word AI being used in this context (of Generative AI) as it exaggerates the claim that a sophisticated statistical model that has the capability to be trained on vast amounts of data by Reinforced Learning from Human Feedback, that can accurately predict the next word in a sentence can be considered as Intelligence, Artificial or other!

These models have a rich history and are continually evolving, offering immense potential for various applications while also raising important ethical and societal considerations.The history of large language models can be traced back to the development of neural networks and natural language processing (NLP) in the 20th century. Early efforts, such as rule-based systems and statistical language models, laid the groundwork for understanding language, but it was the advent of deep learning and the introduction of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that marked a significant turning point. These architectures enabled models to process sequential data like text more effectively, but they were limited by their inability to capture long-range dependencies in language.The breakthrough came with the introduction of transformer architecture in the form of models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). These models, particularly GPT-3, with its 175 billion parameters, demonstrated an extraordinary capacity to understand and generate text. They were pre-trained on vast amounts of text data from the internet and could be fine-tuned for various NLP tasks, from language translation to sentiment analysis, chatbots, and more. This pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm made large language models versatile and widely applicable.Large language models were already being integrated into various industries, including healthcare, finance, customer support, and content generation. They were also used for research in fields like climate science, drug discovery, and social sciences. However, ethical concerns about bias, misinformation, and the environmental impact of training such large models were hotly debated.Looking to the future, the capabilities of large language models are expected to continue expanding. This evolution will likely involve models with even larger parameter sizes, improved fine-tuning techniques, and enhanced understanding of context and user intent. Advancements in hardware, like specialized AI chips and more energy-efficient training methods, will also contribute to their development. Additionally, research into addressing bias, improving explainability, and ensuring the responsible deployment of these models will be essential.In summary, large language models have come a long way in a relatively short time, transforming the landscape of AI and NLP. Their history is marked by a progression from traditional NLP methods to the transformer architecture, and their current state is characterized by widespread adoption and exploration of their capabilities across various domains. In the future, we can anticipate even more powerful and responsible applications of large language models as they continue to push the boundaries of AI and our understanding of language processing." }, { "title": "Hello", "url": "/posts/hello-home/", "categories": "home, hello", "tags": "home, hello, intro, about", "date": "2022-05-31 22:30:00 +0530", "snippet": "Welcome to my postsMore posts to follow….", "content": "Welcome to my postsMore posts to follow…." } ]
