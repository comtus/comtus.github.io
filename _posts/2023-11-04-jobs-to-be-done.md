## Future Talk #3 - There will always be "Jobs to be done" by Humans

### In this Post, I will be talking about the future of Human labor

There have been many speculations on a Post AGI world, especially around human labor. What will be the "Jobs to be done" by humans when we have AGI. There are talks about having a Universal Basic Income (UBI) for all humans as we disengage from Active Labor, where all the mundane jobs are taken over by Agents, Bots which will be guided by one or more AGIs. When we get there, how will human life be transformed? what will we do to keep ourselves sane? These are the hard questions to answer.

It is not IF but When and How.

The path to Post labor era has already begun with GPT4 and Microsoft Co-Pilot. MS will push hard to "Innovate" and transform the workplace - Make current office work more productive. This is similar to what we saw when Graphical computing was introduced, which allowed an order of mangniture change in what people can do with computers. Many predicted the colapse of workforce marketplace as they thought that computers will take our the jobs of mechanics and manufacurers. They did, but we entered into a new era - the information era. Similar transformation is due to the workforce. It is time to transform from Information Era to the Knowledge Era, where human labor is not the driver of value creation. Humans will be contributing to the knowledge base and help AGIs create new values through exponential advancements in science and technology.

Here are some of the outcomes of this transformation:

1. The elimination of disease (be in infectious or inherited).
2. The elimiation of poverty and human suffering.
3. Advancement in enery production, storage and consumption.
4. The attainment of the age of abundance (Infinite Resources, Infinite possibilities).

Apart from the above, we will also see indirect outcomes such as:

1. Lifespan extensions. People could literally live forever, if they prefer.
2. Post labor economy.
