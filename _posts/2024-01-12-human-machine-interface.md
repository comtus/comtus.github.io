## Future Talk #4 - It is time to rethink about Human Machine Interface

### In this Post, I will be talking about the future of Human Machine Interface

The Information era started with the invention of the "Computer" in the 1950s and ushered us into the age of the Machines long before we encountered AI. Computers have become more powerful over the time due to the relenless march of the Moores's Law (or observation) but we are reaching the end of silicon based chips due to physicall limitation of our current technology to cram more transistors in a die as close as physically possible. If we are to move forward, we need to invent new technologies to go beyond the current limits. May be we need other forms of fundamental compute engine using light perhaps (Photonic comupters) or may be Quantum computers?

Still we can achieve more with current (transistor based) computers especially with the help of AI. In fact AI is going to give us better tools to invent future technologies: it will help us advance in material science and nano technology which will inturn enable us to get to Photonic and Quantum computers faster.

There are still some basic issue we need to deal with before we can move forward, especially with Huamn interfaces to these vastly capable machines. If we still rely on current (text or speach based) interfaces, we will not be able to use the complete potential of these next generation computers. Humans need to step up to meet the needs of Machines as we become the bottleneck.

I think we need to think and speak at the speed of light literally if we need to make any progress...
